python data validation library

**EOL Notice** - This project is no longer being maintained, except for major security updates.
(Better schema validation libraries exist now, and I do not have time to develop new features for this one.)

## Run Tests

```bash
docker run -u root -v `pwd`:/tests -it --rm 31z4/tox:4-3
```
